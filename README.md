# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
This project is the assignment of the coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Project.

The goal is to merge and prepare data so it will easiar to analyse.

The data for the exercize is available from 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

and is described at
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

You should uncompress to the dataset.zip to the run_analysis.r folder, so you can perform the following operations:
1-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The final result is a data file -tidyData.txt- that merges and normalizes the training and test data sets according to the 5 steps described.
